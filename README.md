# Population-Branch-Statistic-PBS-Analysis-Pipeline
This R-based computational pipeline calculates Population Branch Statistics (PBS) from pairwise FST data to identify selection signatures in target populations. The PBS statistic measures the extent of allele frequency change in a target population relative to two reference populations, providing insights into recent positive selection.
